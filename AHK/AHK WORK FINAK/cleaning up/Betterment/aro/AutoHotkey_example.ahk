; KeyboardNumber - configured by you in MultiKB_For_AutoHotkey, this identify keyboard device
; VKeyCode - Key Code, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes
; IsDown - is key pressed or released, use "if (!IsDown)" if you like to register only key up, without this your code will be executed twice on key down and key up
; WasDown - like IsDown but this is previous state of this key
; IsExtended - is it normal or extended key (multimedia key, right alt/ctrl etc.)
; LeftCtrl, RightCtrl, LeftAlt, RightAlt, Shift (any) - is corresponding "control key" pressed at the same time
